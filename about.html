              You're obviously here to learn more about me, so let me answer some basic questions to get you up to speed ...
            </p>

            <h1 class="about-header">Who am I?</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              My name is <em>Anthony Candelino</em>. I'm a <em>3rd year student</em> at the <em>University of Guelph</em> 
              pursuing a major in <em>Computer Science</em> with a minor in <em>Business</em>. I am apart of Guelph's 
              <em>co-op program</em> which allows me to complete numerous work terms during my degree. If you'd like to 
              know more about these work terms you can read more about them <a href="work.html"><strong><em>here</em></strong></a>.
            </p>

            <h1 class="about-header">What are your interests?</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              When I'm not in school I try to keep busy with a few hobbies of mine. As a programmer I find it is very important to 
              always be learning new things. The future of software is changing before our very eyes so whether it's through reading
              books or completing online courses, I'm always trying to learn something new. Life isn't all about programming though. 
              So, aside from that I am a huge fan of european soccer. You'll never see a University Student happier to be awake at 7 
              in the morning on a weekend than me (5-7 hour time difference for games). One of my favourite things about soccer is that
              it is played year round in every continent so there is always a game on. 
            </p>

            <h1 class="about-header">Where have you worked so far for your co-op placements?</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Since starting my co-op work I have had the pleasure of working at <em>Tulip Retail</em> in Kitchener as a <em>QA Automation Developer</em>.
              A big part of my job was working through a manual suite of hundreds of functional UI test cases for an iOS/Web app 
              and reducing as much regression testing as possible using automated scripts. By the end me and another co-op ended up 
              reducing the amount of manual testing needed by over 50%. If you'd like to read more about this work term you can read more about it 
              <a href="work.html"><strong><em>here</em></strong></a>.

            </p>

            <h1 class="about-header">When did you first begin programming?</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              While selecting Grade 11 courses I was one short of a full course-load. I was always a huge fan of computers and as I was picking
              courses I came across an intro computer science class. After reading the course description me and a couple friends decided to take
              it together and nothing has been the same since. I still look back at an assignment where we had to create a bubble sort and remember
              thinking how much harder than this can it get, <em>and boy was I wrong</em>.    
            </p>

            <h1 class="about-header">Why did you chose to major in Computer Science?</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              I was always a big fan of 2 things in school. Problem solving and using a computer. So to me, it only made sense to pick the best major
              that incorporates both of these topics. One of my favourite things about computer science is just how vast of a field it has become.
              Software is everywhere these days and I wanted to be a big part of creating what's to come in the future.
