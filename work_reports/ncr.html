            <p class="about-info">              
              If there is a need for innovation when it comes to enterprise technology, NCR will always lead the way. For over 135 years NCR has become the largest 
              global POS software	provider for retail and hospitality while simultaneously being number one when it comes to multi-vendor ATM software. When it comes 
              to NCR, they are as much about hardware as they are about software. Since 1884 NCR has been a leader when it comes to shaping the way people do business 
              all around the world. As time goes on new challenges are thrown in a company’s way and NCR is always trying to be prepared with hardware and software built 
              for tomorrow, rather than today. They are company’s that power the atm’s, self-checkouts, and POS systems we use every day and turn these everyday transactions 
              into meaningful relationships. The following short video goes into a brief overview of the innovations that NCR has brought to market over the years:

            <h1 class="about-header">Working for NCR</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Working for NCR was unlike any other work term I had experienced in the past. The biggest difference for me of course was the remote aspect which
               for someone who had just finished a previous co-op in a similar fashion was not totally shocking. The pandemic started just before my term and left 
               me a bit worried as to whether it would still be happening but I was assured from the new hire coordinator at NCR that I was still going to be hired 
               and how it was going to work. The first day was a simple pick up of my computer and set up as most start but it was a lot different without having 
               someone nearby to ask when things went wrong. Luckily for me, I was provided more than enough information and even what to do if something had gone 
               wrong which lucky for me it did not. The team dynamic at NCR was much different than what I was used to. I was actively involved in daily meetings 
               to discuss with team members the work we had been doing. I felt this daily communicating helped a lot with keeping me on track and motivated as 
               I always wanted to have something to say I had accomplished the day before. Aside from that while I never saw office space I was consistently 
               invited to meet-ups with other co-ops which helped me keep connected with those I should normally be surrounded by. While I never entered the NCR 
               building, I felt by the end that I did not even need to in order to feel like one of the team. My team lead and new hire coordinators went above and 
               beyond to ensure I was integrated into my team and the NCR family as smoothly and effectively as possible.

            <h1 class="about-header">Goals for my Work Term</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              My term at NCR was my first remote work term experience, so I felt as though it was going to be a great opportunity for me to learn new things and prepare for the future. 
              Due to this, I decided that setting four key goals for my upcoming work-term would be beneficial for myself and my work.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                NCR was truly my first insight into the Agile and Scrum frameworks in an actual work environment. From the initial team meetings, I knew I needed to adjust and learn the 
                process that I would be working with over the course of my term. One of the main things I wanted to focus on is ensuring I understood the process of what to work on and 
                when to assist others and as each sprint went on I felt I was making improvements in my personal process. I also was able to contribute more from a communication standpoint 
                when it came to making decisions and choosing what tasks I would like to work on.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                I knew that since this was a “remote” work term that I would need to adjust to different formalities when it came to communicating not just my ideas and work but also when 
                it came to getting assistance. From the get-go, I always strived to try to speak as much as I could and contribute however much I could when it came to closing tasks before 
                the end of sprints. In previous roles I know I would be reluctant to ask for guidance when I got hit an obstacle but because people were trusting me to work from home they 
                needed to know when I was unable to.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                As stated above, the remote work environment made it more difficult to get assistance from team members. Therefore, I knew that I did not have the luxury of being able to ask 
                them for help on stuff I had already asked about previously. Whenever I got guidance from a team member, I made sure to curate a list of notes that I could reference later 
                so I didn’t need to waste other’s time. As time went on I also learned where I could find a lot of documentation and reading material about projects which often saved me 
                from needing to even ask questions.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                With each new placement, I have had brought its own company rules and standards. With a company so invested in financial systems and software I really 
                wanted to ensure I knew what their work processes, coding standards, and documentation interpretations were. Coming in it was a bit daunting as there 
                were many guidelines but in the end, I found them quite beneficial because you always knew exactly what you had to do whether you were updating 
                documentation, closing a story, or beginning work on a completely new project. By the end of my term, I felt I had learned the process to the 
                point where I didn’t need to check to ensure I was completing my work correctly which showed great progress from my initial tasks I worked on.

            <h1 class="about-header">My role as a <em>Software Developer</em></h1>
              
              <p class="about-info">
                This was my first time with the position title of Software Developer, and it was different than the other experiences that I have had. 
                During my time with NCR, we worked in sprint cycles to complete the story's we were given over a project iteration. Due to this fast-paced 
                and agile work environment, I found myself learning about a different one of NCR's projects every 2 weeks. With each sprint, I was assigned 
                to a different and foreign project for me, which made each task I accomplished more challenging but also more rewarding. Nearing the end I 
                found myself quite familiar with getting started on most of the work I was assigned but feel had I worked at the office instead of remote 
                I would have gotten the hang of things a lot sooner.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As far as tasks go, I was given quite a big responsibility within my first weeks of working with my team. I was put in charge of generalizing 
                and moving the integration test suite of a single project into its own separate project so it could be utilized as a dependency for numerous 
                other projects in NCR's system. Considering this was my first real task it was quite challenging but also very rewarding, especially as I got 
                feedback throughout the process.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After my first month, there was a huge reshuffle of teams due to the pandemic and deadlines that needed to be met by the end of summer. I went 
                from just working solo to within an agile team environment. This for me was something that I found very interesting as I had yet to work using 
                sprints and product iterations. The timing was great considering the iteration was 12 weeks long and lasted just in time for my term to end. 
                It took some time to get used to, but I definitely found my ground as each sprint progressed. I started with basic tasks like adding integration 
                tests to projects using the framework I refactored, but by the end of my term, I was changing APIs that affected software people used every day.
            </p>  

            <h1 class="about-header">Acknowledgments</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Working remote meant I did not meet a lot of external team members, but it did mean that I was even closer with the ones I spoke and worked with 
              every day. I would first like to thank Freddi and Angela for providing me with the offer and guiding me through onboarding during very stressful 
              and unusual circumstances. It must have been quite difficult coordinating with that many new and existing co-ops daily especially in a remote 
              environment. Next, I would like to acknowledge my team lead and mentor Callum. Whenever I had questions, especially during onboarding, he was super 
              helpful and always willing to help or point me towards someone who could be even more helpful. Aside from them, I would like to thank the rest of my 
              team members: Raymond, Daniel, Miguel, Art, and Anitha for all they did in ensuring they were helpful and getting the best out of me. I cannot thank 
              them enough for all the help they provided throughout my term.
            </p>

            <h1 class="about-header">Conclusion</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              I recall when I was first offered the role that I was told that when you work for NCR you aren't "Just a co-op, you will contribute to meaningful 
              work that people use every day". Usually, when you see something like this you may be a bit skeptical thinking it was a marketing tool but I can 
              truly say this is one of those co-op's where you don't feel like the intern on your team. I found myself often explaining to new and existing team 
              members the work I was doing and how it would benefit what we were trying to achieve. This term was truly was a meaningful and important job that 
              prepared me well for my future in a similar field and opened my eyes to a new sector of tech that I hadn't considered wanting to be interested in before.
