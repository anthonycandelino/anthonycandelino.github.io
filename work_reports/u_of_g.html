            <p class="about-info">              
              At the University of Guelph there are many departments that seamlessly come together daily to make student and staff’s 
              lives run smoothly. One of the most important of these departments is Hospitality Services. Hospitality Services overlooks 
              student meal plans, bookstore sales, food and vending services, catering, graduation ceremonies, and numerous other 
              initiatives all over campus. On the technological side of Hospitality Services, there are numerous online applications 
              that help staff and students with all their hospitality needs including online services, SNAP, and vending services to 
              name a few.

            <h1 class="about-header">Working at the University</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Coming into this work term I assumed that working a job on campus wouldn’t be much different than doing homework on campus 
              during the school year. Sitting down, completing tasks by deadlines and learning all at the same time. However, after just 
              a week of working I quickly realized this was not the case. The job was a lot more agile than schoolwork, with objectives 
              and tasks constantly changing over the course of a project’s development. Being the sole developer of these projects, I 
              enjoyed the decision-making process as it made me think about changes and their implications on the existing code I was 
              working with. Since this was a relatively new position, the first few weeks were truly a learning experience. Lots of the 
              tools I was working with were ones I had not had experience with. Since the position itself was newer, I was asked to develop 
              documentation to expedite the onboarding process of future co-ops in this position. From the get-go my team members were 
              super supportive whenever I had questions about how things worked, but I knew they were quite busy so I often took learning 
              into my own hands which kept me on track on getting up to speed with the tools I was working with. As I became more familiar 
              with existing projects and their repositories I was entrusted with numerous responsibilities. The team trusted me and gave me 
              every opportunity possible to contribute to the future projects coming into play. This trust was most noticeable near the end 
              when I was making changes to bigger more important websites that I never would have imagined I’d have access to. I always felt 
              like an important member of the team, and it helped significantly in my confidence in my work throughout my term.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                From previous work experience I have usually worked on projects with a team which was why I set working better individually as 
                a goal of mine. While I usually work on my own in school, many of my projects don’t involve changing projects and timelines so 
                this was something totally new to me. As the months progressed, I became a lot more accustomed to this work style and learned when 
                I should get help and ask for feedback on projects.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                .Net was something I had quite a vague idea about coming into this position. And while I had used SQL before, 
                I hadn’t run into any situations where I would need to integrate it into .Net Applications. I spent most of my 
                first few weeks reading lots of documentation and existing code and by the end of my term I was a lot more 
                comfortable than I ever imagined I’d be with .Net applications. While I was far from an expert, I learned a lot, 
                and I felt it made me a lot better developer overall.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                Knowing I was the sole developer in my team, I didn’t have a person to go to when I ran into issues with code. 
                Therefore, I set this goal to ensure that I would learn to find out where to go to when I needed help. While it 
                was difficult at first, I slowly learned where to go for resources and even found myself troubleshooting on my own 
                at times. In the end, these issues made me a more concrete problem solver and helped me to understand how to find 
                the root cause of problems.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                As I mentioned above, this was a relatively undocumented position. There wasn’t any onboarding or references to 
                look at when starting out so a big goal of mine was to ensure the next co-ops would be left better off with at 
                least a starting point of references when it comes to projects. During my term I documented everything I learned 
                and references I used to ensure co-ops would not only have a great starting point but would be able to use the 
                documentation all throughout their co-op term as well. This was one of my biggest achievements outside of code as 
                it really setup future co-ops for success in this position.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                Being a sole developer, I was constantly working on meeting deadlines with effective results. With each meeting 
                I had with managers I always ensured I asked everything I needed to so that I would be able to apply it towards 
                the final project. I quickly learned that I needed to not only use my time wisely but effectively in order to work 
                with this feedback system and by the end of my term I felt a lot more comfortable creating great projects in a shorter 
                period of time.

            <h1 class="about-header">My role as an <em>Application Developer</em></h1>
              
              <p class="about-info">
                During my four months of working at the University, most of my time was spent working on improvements on numerous 
                existing web applications used by the University. The department I worked in oversaw a lot of projects and by the 
                end of my term I had seen the behind the scenes workings of many websites that I use on campus as a student 
                during my studies. One of the most interesting parts about my job is the amount of freedom and decision making 
                I could have as the sole developer of many projects. As you can imagine though, being the sole developer often 
                came with various responsibilities as well. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There were times when I was managing multiple projects at once and needed to prioritize issues that may have 
                occurred along the way. Most of my programming revolved around designing web applications using the .NET framework 
                as it integrated well with the existing architecture my department had established. Most of the tools I worked 
                with were totally new to me, and it took a lot of reading and understanding before I totally got the hang of things, 
                but once I did it only got better from there.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                One of my bigger projects near the end of my term gave me a great experience in integrating a new feature into the 
                campus meal plan data portal that helped significantly in simplifying a tedious and manual process that was previously 
                prone to human error. This position really brought me to a new level with creative thinking and managing a varying 
                workload. Some of the projects I worked on are quite big and used by a lot of people and it made me more focused on 
                ensuring a proper solution was implemented to problems. This position was eye opening for numerous reasons and teached 
                me a lot about attention to detail.
            </p>  

            <h1 class="about-header">Acknowledgements</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              There are a few people I worked with that I would especially like to thank. To begin, I’d like to thank my managers 
              Altaf and Munny for providing me with such a great learning opportunity. There are many things I learned at this job 
              that I will carry with me for the rest of my professional career. On top of that, I’d like to thank the rest of the 
              team for their assistance whenever I needed it and even going the extra mile to make sure stuff they were doing wouldn’t 
              impact projects I was working on. From the first day on the job everyone was welcoming and ensured I felt like an 
              important member of the team. I wish all the best to the team going forward as they embark on new projects with 
              future co-op’s and employees and I am confident they will go successfully.  While my team was small, each person 
              on it helped me along my way and for that I am grateful.
