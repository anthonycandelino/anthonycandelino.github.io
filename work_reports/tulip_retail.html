            <p class="about-info">              
              In the age of e-commerce Tulip strived to take a different approach in retail by building the world’s first cloud-based 
              retail platform made exclusively for store associates. Tulip bloomed in 2013 out of a team of developers from 
              <a href="https://well.ca/"><em>Well.ca</em></a>, a health and beauty e-commerce retailer, who wanted to deliver a meaningful
              experience to customers within physical stores through software. Utilizing a partnership with Apple, Tulip is taking a world 
              leading mobile device and put it in the hands of store associates to simplify and enhance the in-store experience. Whether it's through
              assisted selling, endless aisle, customer communication, or POS, Tulip aims to deliver an unparalleled omnichannel shopping experience
              with clients including: Estée Lauder, Saks Fifth Avenue, Chanel, and Michael Kors to name a few.

            <h1 class="about-header">Working at Tulip</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              If there's one thing Tulip is known for it is being a unique and interesting place to work. From the festivus holiday traditions to
              weekly lunches and events there was never a dull moment in the office in my 4 months there. I mean, we even had an office move mid-way 
              through my work term and how often can you say that. From the first day, everyone at Tulip was welcoming. For co-ops they have a "buddy system" 
              where a full-time employee or another co-op who has been there prior will be your mentor for your time there. Fortunate for me, my buddy that
              greeted my on the first day was another co-op who I had met before because we are in the same program. Upon greeting me he showed me to my desk
              where I found this:
              <div class="center-text" style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
                <img width="560" src="../img/welcome_to_tulip.JPG">
              </div>
              Which I found to be a very nice gesture because it assured me that people were excited to meet and work with me. Since me and my buddy were both on 
              the same team we worked closely on everthing we did and we were at one point the only people working on the autiomation scripts QA was writing,
              as crazy as that sounds. Tulip really strives to go the extra mile to ensure co-ops are contributing to the future of the company which was 
              something that stood out to me the most. Everyone was so welcoming there was times where I forgot I was a co-op and it made the experience that much better.

              Tulip was my first co-op work experience so I knew it was going to be a great opportunity for me to learn new things. Before learning, I decided
              setting some goals would be a step in the right direction ...

                Coming into Tulip, I didn't have a great amount of experience with JavaScript aside from one web-development course I had taken. After a few days of 
                learning about the software Tulip developed I took it upon myself to learn some JavaScript on the side to expedite the onboarding process. The hardest 
                part was learning how JavaScript at its core is utilized using the automation frameworks we used, but after help from experienced team members and through 
                my own experience I found it like second nature during my final weeks. After a completing some online courses and using it on a daily basis at work I can
                confidently say I know a lot more about JavaScript now than what I knew on my first day, and for that I am grateful.

                Working at Tulip was my first experience working with full-time software developers and business professionals. Knowing this, I felt it
                was a great opportunity to meet new people and learn a lot about the industry. During my work term I spoke to a lot of developers and project 
                managers to learn about their paths and get some advice that would help me in the future. I also made great friends with other co-ops that I
                worked with, some of them being older and they gave me advice with the experience they've had. I connected with many of my co-workers on LinkedIn  
                and encouraged them to stay in touch, because you never know when your paths are going to cross again.

              <h1 class="about-header">My role as a<em>Test Automation Developer</em></h1>
              
              <p class="about-info">
              During my 4 months working for Tulip a majority of my time was spent working on a project to replace hundreds of end-user manual test 
              cases with automated scripts that would run nightly on Tulips iOS/Web applications. The main goal of our team was to reduce as many manual 
              test cases as possible in an effort to reduce the time and money needed to test a product before its release. One of the most interesting 
              parts about my job was I got to see firsthand a project being developed from concept to production and by the end of my term we even got 
              our first client team involved with using our suite of scripts.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This being my first co-op experience there was a bit of a learning curve with the stack that Tulip uses. For the most part my job revolved around
              using Git and JavaScript which were 2 things I had very minimal experience with from my school work. Git was something that was always recommended
              to me by peers to use for my school work but I never understood it's true use-case until this job. While there was a lot of JavaScript being used it
              was not basic loops and functions. We used an automation framework CodeceptJS, that was extended to work on Tulip's hybrid iOS/Web application using 
              helpers from Appium and WebdriverIO, other automation frameworks. Before starting this job I was worried about using new technology but I am glad
              I had to reach out of my comfort zone and try some new things as it taught me some valuable skills I will be using in the future.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              After getting comfortable with automation and Tulip's product offering I was assigned to work on writing scripts for automating testing on specific 
              features of the application. My daily work was quite repetitive but because of the vast amount of features to be covered I was always working on
              something different. Me and my team would have a daily scrum to discuss what we worked on the day before and what we were working on today. This 
              ensured we always knew what everyone was working on and if we needed help who could be of assistance. Our technical lead was an outsourced worker
              from Belarus so it was often difficult to get help throughout the day so these morning scrums were helpful in clearing up issues from the day before.
              In the final week of my work at Tulip our team cut our first release branch for our project. This was one of the biggest achievements my team had in the 
              time I was there as it showed that all our work was well out of the early concept stages it was in months prior. It was truly a great learning experience
              to be apart of a meaningful project that other teams in Tulip will be using in the future.

            <h1 class="about-header">Acknowledgements</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Where to begin, there's too many people to thank. For starters I'd like to thank Tulip as a whole for
              a memorable and meaningful work term I won't forget. I'd like to thank Stephanie Wagner for a pleasant 
              onboarding into Tulip and for being so helpful with any questions I had before and during my work term. On 
              top of that I'd like to thank the Clienteling team in KW: Nick, Milosz, Dariusz, Ryan, Cem, and Brad, for 
              always being there to not only answer any questions I had but for always going the extra mile to help me out.
              As far as my team goes there is a couple of people I'd like to especially thank. I'll start with thanking
              the head of QA Mona Upadhye for giving me the opportunity to work for such a great team. Mona was great to
              work for. She always was eager to learn about what we were working on and how it would help the future of QA at
              Tulip. I'd also like to thank the other members of my team Jonathan Hovich, Yury Talapila, and Gagangeep Singh. 
              From the beginning until the end these 3 continued to teach me new things that I used every day. I wish all the 
              best to the team as they embark on a deeper investigation of automation across all of Tulip and I am sure they will 
              successful. 
            </p>

            <h1 class="about-header">Conclusion</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
                While my time at Tulip was short, it was meaningful and it opened my eyes to the software industry and just how important 
                it is at every level. Whether you're a co-op or a full-time development manager you truly feel like you're contributing to
                the future of Tulip and for that I am grateful.
