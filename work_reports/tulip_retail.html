            <p class="about-info">              
              In the age of e-commerce, Tulip strived to take a different approach in retail by building the world’s first cloud-based
              retail platform made exclusively for store associates. Tulip bloomed in 2013, out of a team of developers from  
              <a href="https://well.ca/"><em>Well.ca</em></a>, a health and beauty e-commerce retailer, who wanted to deliver a meaningful
              experience to customers within physical stores through the use of software. Utilizing a partnership with Apple, Tulip was 
              able to take a world leading mobile device and put it in the hands of store associates to simplify and enhance the in-store 
              experience. Whether it's through assisted selling, endless aisle, customer communication, or POS, Tulip delivers an unparalleled
              omnichannel shopping experience with clients including: Estée Lauder, Saks Fifth Avenue, Chanel, and Michael Kors, to name a few.

            <h1 class="about-header">Working at Tulip</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Tulip is a unique and interesting environment to work in. The unique elements of the Tulip workplace included events such as 
              the Festivus holiday traditions in December  to weekly team lunches which led to there never being a dull moment in the office
              during my four months there. From the first day I started at Tulip, everyone was warm and welcoming. For co-op students, Tulip
              implements a "buddy system" in which a full-time employee or another co-op student that has been working at Tulip prior to your
              arrival is assigned as a mentor. Fortunately for me, my "buddy" was another co-op student who I had previously met in a lab at 
              the University of Guelph, where we both attend. Upon greeting me, my "buddy" Jonathan showed me to my desk where I found this 
              greeting card: 
            </p>

            <div class="center-text" style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
              <img width="560" src="../img/welcome_to_tulip.JPG">
            </div>

            <p class="about-info"> 
              I felt that this card was a very nice gesture, as it assured me that my new co-workers were excited to meet and work alongside me. 
              Since my "buddy" and I were both assigned to work on the same team, we began to work closely with one another on our team's projects, 
              and at one point we were the only people working on the automation scripts QA was writing, which was definitely a cool experience. 
              Tulip  seemed to strive to do everything possible to ensure that it's co-op students are able to contribute to the future of the company, 
              which was something about the company that really stood out to me. Additionally, everyone that I met from the company was so welcoming, 
              so much so that I often forgot that I was a co-op student at all. This inviting aspect ingrained in the workplace culture of Tulip made 
              my work experience there even better.

            <h1 class="about-header">Goals for my Work Term</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Tulip was my first co-op work term experience, so I felt as though it was going to be a great opportunity for me to learn new things. However, 
              before I began working at Tulip I decided that setting some goals for my upcoming work-term would be beneficial.
            </p>

            <details>
              <summary class="about-info-summary"><em><strong>" </strong></em>Develop a better understanding of JavaScript<em><strong>"</strong></em></summary>
              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                Coming into Tulip, I didn't have a great amount of experience with JavaScript - aside from one web-development course I had taken on it. 
                After a few days of learning about the software that Tulip had developed, I took it upon myself to learn some JavaScript on the side to 
                expedite the learning process. The hardest part of learning this language was understanding how JavaScript at its core is utilized through 
                Tulip's automation frameworks. However, after some help from other more experienced team members and through my own trial and error, JavaScript 
                became second nature during my final weeks at Tulip. After a completing some online courses on this language and using it daily at work, I can
                now confidently say I know a lot more about JavaScript than what I knew on the first day of my work term.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                My team at Tulip was quite small, therefore I was able to gain some great hands-on work experience with tools and software that I had never seen
                or worked with previously. Within my first couple of weeks, my team and I had laid out a roadmap to develop a suite of automation scripts that 
                I was able to actively contribute to during my time there. Over the course of my four month work term, my "buddy" and I were the two main developers
                of these scripts and were able to make  great progress towards the final product of them. Our original goal was to reduce manual testing by 33% but
                after dozens of merge requests we found ourselves  reducing it by over 50% , which was quite a massive achievement for our team. Considering that 
                I was a student on my first co-op work-term, it felt great being able to contribute to a big software project that was able to change the future of
                QA at Tulip.

                The time I spent at Tulip was my first experience working alongside full-time software developers and business professionals. 
                Consequently, I felt it to be a great opportunity to meet new people and learn a lot about the industry. During my work term, 
                I spoke to many developers and project managers to learn about their career paths and gain access to some valuable advice to 
                help me in my own future endeavors. I also made great friends with other co-op students that I worked with, and I ended up connecting
                with many of my co-workers on LinkedIn and encouraged them to stay in touch, as I enjoyed my time working with them and found their
                life experience and advice very interesting and helpful.

            <h1 class="about-header">My role as a<em>Test Automation Developer</em></h1>
              
              <p class="about-info">
                During my four months of working for Tulip, most of my time was spent working on a project to replace hundreds of end-user manual test 
                cases with automated scripts that would run nightly on Tulips iOS/Web applications. The main goal of our team was to reduce as many 
                manual test cases as possible to reduce the time and money needed to test a product before its release. One of the most interesting parts
                about my job was that I got to see and contribute to a project being developed from concept to production and by the end of my term we 
                even got our first client team involved with using our suite of scripts. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                For the most part my job revolved around using Git and JavaScript which were two things I had very minimal experience with from my school 
                work. Git was always recommended to me by peers to use for my school work, but I never understood it's true use-case until my time at Tulip. 
                While there was a lot of JavaScript being used, it was not always basic loops and functions. We often used an automation framework CodeceptJS, 
                that was extended to work on Tulip's hybrid iOS/Web application using helpers from Appium and WebdriverIO; other automation frameworks. Before
                starting this job I was a bit worried about the length of the learning curve with using new technology, but I am glad I was able to reach out
                of my comfort zone and try some new technological aspects as it taught me many valuable skills that I will be able to utilize in the future. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After getting comfortable with automation and Tulip's product offering, I was assigned to work on writing scripts for automating testing on 
                specific features of the application. My daily work was quite repetitive but due to the vast number of features to be covered, I was always 
                working on something different. My team and I would have a daily scrum to discuss what we worked on the day before and what we were working 
                on for that day. These daily scrums ensured that our team always knew what everyone was expected to be working on and who could be of assistance
                if we needed help with our assignments. Our technical lead was an outsourced worker based in Belarus, therefore the time change between Belarus
                and Ontario made it a bit  difficult to get help from him throughout the work day, so these early morning scrums were helpful in clearing up any
                issues from the day before. In the final week of my work-term at Tulip, our team cut our first release branch for our project. This was one of
                the biggest achievements my team and I had during my time at Tulip and it was a very proud moment for us as it showed that all of our work was
                well out of the early concept stages it was in months prior to that moment. It was a truly great learning experience to be a part of a meaningful
                project that other teams in Tulip will be using in the future.

            <h1 class="about-header">Acknowledgements</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Where to begin, there is too many people that I would like to thank! To begin, I'd like to thank Tulip as a whole for a such memorable and meaningful
              work term of which I will never forget. I'd also like to thank Stephanie Wagner for a pleasant onboarding into Tulip, as well as for being so helpful
              with any questions I had before/during my work term. Additionally, I'd like to say a big thank you to the Clienteling team in KW: Nick, Milosz, 
              Dariusz, Ryan, Cem, and Brad, for always being there to not only answer any questions I had, but for always going the extra mile to help me out. As 
              far as my team, there is a couple of people I'd like to thank especially; I'll start with thanking the head of QA - Mona Upadhye for giving me the 
              opportunity to work for such a great team within Tulip. Mona was wonderful to work with as she was always eager to learn about what we were working 
              on and how it would help the future of QA at Tulip. Lastly, I'd like to thank the other members of my team; Jonathan Hovich, Yury Talapila, and Gagangeep
              Singh. From my first day on the job to my last these three awesome guys continued to teach me new things that I still use every day. I wish all the best
              to the team as they embark on a deeper investigation of automation across all of Tulip's software and I am quite confident that they will be very successful.
            </p>

            <h1 class="about-header">Conclusion</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              While my time at Tulip was short, it was very meaningful in many different ways. Working at Tulip gave me a lot of insight into the software industry 
              and just how complex and important this technology is at every level of a company. Whether you're a co-op student or a full-time software developer at 
              Tulip, you will be able to truly  contribute to the future of Tulip as a company and for that aspect I am deeply grateful.
