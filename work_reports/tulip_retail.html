            <h1 class="about-header">Acknowledgements</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Where to begin, there's too many people to thank. For starters I'd like to thank Tulip as a whole for
              a memorable and meaningful work term I won't forget. I'd like to thank Stephanie Wagner for a pleasant 
              onboarding into Tulip and for being so helpful with any questions I had before and during my work term. On 
              top of that I'd like to thank the Clienteling team in KW: Nick, Milosz, Dariusz, Ryan, Cem, and Brad, for 
              always being there to not only answer any questions I had but for always going the extra mile to help me out.
              As far as my team goes there is a couple of people I'd like to especially thank. I'll start with thanking
              the head of QA Mona Upadhye for giving me the opportunity to work for such a great team. Mona was great to
              work for. She always was eager to learn about what we were working on and how it would help the future of QA at
              Tulip. I'd also like to thank the other members of my team Jonathan Hovich, Yury Talapila, and Gagangeep Singh. 
              From the beginning until the end these 3 continued to teach me new things that I used every day. I remember 
              during my first week the whole QA team was concerned our automation framework wasn't going to pan out and it's
              amazing to see just how far we came in a short time of 4 months. I wish all the best to the team as they embark
              on a deeper investigation of automation across all of Tulip and I am sure they will successful. While my time at 
              Tulip was short, it was meaningful and it opened my eyes to the software industry and just how important it is at
              every level. Whether you're a co-op or a full time development manager you truly feel like you're contributing to
              the future of Tulip and for that I am grateful.
            </p>
