            <h1 class="about-header">About the Company</h1>

            <p class="about-info">              
              In the complex and innovative finance industry, Sun Life Financial is one of the largest and oldest financial services companies in the world. 
              What started as a life insurance company back in 1865 has now blown up into a massive institution specializing in nearly everything to do with 
              customers and their finances. Their slogan, "Life's brighter under the sun" encapsulates their main missions which include leadership in the 
              financial sector, innovation towards tapping into new markets, and sustainability not just in their portfolio but in their environmental impacts 
              as well. Sun Life understands that not everyone has the time and expertise to be maintaining their finances and investments, which is why they 
              supply advisors and their abilities to help those when they need it. No matter your financial goals, Sun Life is with you every step of the way 
              to allow you to live your life your way. 
            </p>

            <h1 class="about-header">Working at (and away from) Sun Life</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Sun Life was one of the most interesting environments I have worked in so far. Never before was I working in such a large office building alongside
              so many team members. On the first day, the company took over 50 co-ops (just at my office) and got us together to meet each other. With such a daunting
              office space with hundreds of people, it was great to have people my age to be able to relate and connect with from the get-go. One of the people I was
              with even happened to work on my floor and collaborated with me on a few projects as team members. Within the first day, I was already comfortable with
              all the welcoming team members around me and knew for the most part what type of work I would be contributing to in my short four-month period. Whenever
              I needed assistance there was always someone on my team who could guide me through issues, even when it came time for remote work. The hardest part 
              about the whole company going remote is you never really know what's going to happen next. Even with this though, daily calls and meetings throughout
              my last month and a half made it so easy to be able to get help and contribute my work. I even felt at times I was more productive from a home environment
              which was a different experience for sure.
            </p>

            <h1 class="about-header">Goals for my Work Term</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Sun Life was my first semi-remote work term experience, so I felt as though it was going to be a great opportunity for me to learn new things and prepare for the future. 
              Due to this, I decided that setting four key goals for my upcoming work-term would be beneficial for myself and my work.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                Sun Life was truly my first insight into the inner workings of corporate culture. With each decision made, thousands of customers and employee's lives 
                were most likely affected whether they liked it or not which opened my eyes as to why things were more strict than some of the other work I have been 
                accustomed to. I feel that even though I didn't get a full four months at the office, the corporate culture was very welcoming and allowed me to adapt 
                myself to fit in well whether it was online or at my desk.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                One of the main projects I worked on during my time at Sun Life was a solo project where I was upgrading their health check system for all of the app 
                services they managed. This project for me was a great experience because not only did it allow me to solve problems myself but it also provided me with
                 the opportunity to be able to take a functioning project and upgrade it to a more modern solution. My main goal for this project was to take what was 
                 already there and make it easier to use for anyone at the company and from beginning to end I felt I accomplished just that.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                While in school, we touch on OOP from time to time but never in the applied ways you see on a co-op term. The work I completed at Sun Life involved 
                mostly all Java and Spring which are two technologies I've wanted to try and improve on for future opportunities. With all the work I completed, I 
                feel I improved immensely in my Java knowledge and got a great first impression working with the Spring Framework. In my next co-op, I will be using 
                both these technologies again so I am glad to have this experience beforehand.

              <p class="about-info about-info-details">
                As stated above, this was truly a unique work environment for me. Not only did I see new technologies that I wasn't accustomed to, but I also worked
                in different and even remote work environments. To me being able to adapt to all these new ways of working was great and gave me great experience for
                the future. I learned early how quickly work can change and how I needed to be ready to adjust how I work to continue to deliver.

            <h1 class="about-header">My role as an <em>Application Developer</em></h1>
              
              <p class="about-info">
                During my four months of working for Sun Life, most of my time was spent working on a project to upgrade the company's health check for its 
                microservices used in all of their applications. The main goal of this project was to take the bare-bones request URLs that were there and 
                upgrade the system with an overhauled user interface and new features to enable and disable services. The most interesting part about this 
                project was I got to lead the whole development cycle of a project that would be used by countless people after I was done my term so I 
                wanted to ensure I gave it my best effort and asked lots of questions along the way.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                For the most part, my job revolved around using Java and Spring Boot which were two things I had very minimal experience with in a 
                work environment. While I had the Object-Oriented experience from school and personal projects I never applied it in the ways that 
                I did at Sun Life. Due to my limited experience with these two tools, I was a bit worried about the length of the learning curve and 
                my ability to be able to make a lasting impact on the company's software. However, from day one the team was great at guiding me through 
                roadblocks and being able to get me up to speed with the projects and tools, I'd be using.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After getting comfortable with my toolset and the company's applications I'd be working on, I was some minor fixes to get me comfortable 
                with making changes on such large applications and testing them to ensure they would work. Once they knew I was comfortable with their 
                apps I began my term project which I described above. When I was at the office, I took advantage of having my team members surrounding me 
                for all my questions but once things got remote being productive and getting help became a lot more difficult. However, with our daily standup 
                meetings, I always got the help I needed and by the end of the term, they couldn't have been happier with the work I had completed. While I only
                worked with a few key employees they always made sure to set aside time to assist me in overcoming complexities in the company's software system. 
                By the time the last week came around I gave an online demo to numerous team members so they could see how this would improve their workflow when 
                testing the stability of microservices. After all the feedback I felt like I accomplished my term project which truly was a great feeling. Another 
                great thing is many of the tools I learned to use I actually will end up using at my next co-op so to me that's a bonus. It was a truly great 
                learning experience to be a part of a meaningful project that other teams in Sun Life will be using in the future.
            </p>  

            <h1 class="about-header">Acknowledgements</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              Where to begin, there are too many people that I would like to thank! To begin, I'd like to thank Sun Life as a whole for such memorable and meaningful 
              work term of which I will never forget. I'd like to thank my manager Bill for a pleasant onboarding into Sun Life, and for giving me such a beneficial 
              meaningful opportunity. Even when times got tough with COVID-19 I was assured I would continue to work and for that I was grateful. Additionally, I'd like 
              to say a big thank you to my team members: Kapil, David, and Ayman, for always being there to not only answer any questions I had but for always going the 
              extra mile to help me out. Lastly, I'd like to thank the other members on my floor, too many to name but in my short time there we had some great events 
              and projects that we worked on together at the office. I wish my team all the best with all of the system upgrades they are planning over the summer and 
              after working with them for only four months, I am quite confident their expertise will lead them to be successful.
            </p>

            <h1 class="about-header">Conclusion</h1>

            <p class="about-info">
              While my time as Sun Life was short, and time at the office even shorter, it was very meaningful in many different ways. Working at Sun Life gave me a lot of
              positive insight into the corporate office lifestyle and gave me new appreciation towards things I never had realized prior to this co-op. While there was so 
              team members I worked with, I felt my work was just as important as any other smaller company I have been apart of, and to me that was the most important.
              Whether you're a co-op student or a full-time worker at Sun Life, you will be able to truly contribute to the future of the company which is awesome.
